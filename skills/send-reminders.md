You are running the daily appointment reminder task. This is typically run automatically every morning via a scheduled task, but can also be triggered manually.

## Step 1: Get today's appointments

Use your connected Google Calendar to fetch today's events. For each event, extract:
- **Contact name** — from the attendee name or event title
- **Phone number** — from the description, notes, location, or attendee fields
- **Appointment time** — the event start time
- **Type** — from the event title (e.g. "Consultation", "Follow-up", "Intake")

## Step 2: Filter and prepare

- Skip events without a phone number (note them as skipped)
- Deduplicate by phone — if someone has multiple appointments, keep the earliest
- Format phone numbers to E.164 (add +31 for Netherlands if no country code)

**If no appointments with phone numbers:**
"No appointments with phone numbers found for today. Nothing to send."
Stop here.

## Step 3: Send reminders

For each contact — do NOT ask for confirmation, send automatically:

1. Call `generate_whatsapp_message` with their name, appointment time, and type
2. Call `send_whatsapp_message` with the phone, generated message, contact name, and time
3. Note the result

## Step 4: Report

Give a brief summary:
"✅ Sent 4 reminders for today's appointments:
- Sarah Johnson — 10:00 AM consultation
- Mike de Vries — 11:30 AM follow-up
- Lisa Bakker — 2:00 PM intake
- Tom Hendriks — 4:00 PM review

⏭️ Skipped 1 (no phone number): Team standup at 9:00 AM"
